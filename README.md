# Greetings from Huy Anh! 🌌

## 👨‍💻 About me

I'm currently navigating the thrilling world of Computer Vision and Machine Learning for my Ph.D. at Stony Brook University. It's a lot like being a digital Indiana Jones, but instead of ancient artifacts, I'm uncovering the secrets of pixels and algorithms.

## 🌐 Life Beyond Pixels

I'm a culinary explorer (where success is measured by the smoke alarm's silence), a globe-trotter (collecting passport stamps like Pokémon), and an old architecture admirer (because there's something about buildings that have seen more history than I have). In short, I'm on a perpetual quest to learn, whether it's from books, people, or the whispering walls of ancient universities.

Life's too short to live in monochrome, so I add a splash of color wherever I go, be it through code, cuisine, or conversation.
